# *React and Forms*

HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name:
```
<form>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input type="text" name="name" />
  </label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```
The `<FormControl>` component renders a form control with Bootstrap styling. The `<FormGroup>` component wraps a form control with proper spacing, along with support for a label, help text, and validation state. To ensure accessibility, set controlId on `<FormGroup>`, and use `<FormLabel>` for the label.
```
<Form>
  <Form.Group className="mb-3" controlId="formBasicEmail">
    <Form.Label>Email address</Form.Label>
    <Form.Control type="email" placeholder="Enter email" />
    <Form.Text className="text-muted">
      We'll never share your email with anyone else.
    </Form.Text>
  </Form.Group>

  <Form.Group className="mb-3" controlId="formBasicPassword">
    <Form.Label>Password</Form.Label>
    <Form.Control type="password" placeholder="Password" />
  </Form.Group>
  <Form.Group className="mb-3" controlId="formBasicCheckbox">
    <Form.Check type="checkbox" label="Check me out" />
  </Form.Group>
  <Button variant="primary" type="submit">
    Submit
  </Button>
</Form>
```
The <FormControl> component directly renders the <input> or other specified component. If you need to access the value of an uncontrolled <FormControl>, attach a ref to it as you would with an uncontrolled input, then call ReactDOM.findDOMNode(ref) to get the DOM node. You can then interact with that node as you would with any other uncontrolled input.
  
  # *Controlled Components*

  In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

For example, if we want to make the previous example log the name when it is submitted, we can write the form as a controlled component:
  ```
  class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: ''};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
  ```
