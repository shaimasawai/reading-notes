  **HTML also supports description lists. A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term. The ``<dl>`` tag defines the description list, the ``<dt>`` tag defines the term (name), and the ``<dd>`` tag describes each term:**

 ## **The compounents of the CSS box model:**

 * The content area, bounded by the content edge, contains the “real” content of the element, such as text, an image, or a video player. Its dimensions are the content width (or content-box width) and the content height (or content-box height). It often has a background color or background image.

 * The padding area, bounded by the padding edge, extends the content area to include the element’s padding. Its dimensions are the padding-box width and the padding-box height.

 * The border area, bounded by the border edge, extends the padding area to include the element’s borders. Its dimensions are the border-box width and the border-box height.

 * The margin area, bounded by the margin edge, extends the border area to include an empty area used to separate the element from its neighbors. Its dimensions are the margin-box width and the margin-box height.


 ## **CSS Overflow**

The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area, and works only for block elements with specified height

### **CSS Border Styles:**
This featuer let us to choose how we can display the borders like :

1. dotted - Defines a dotted border

2. dashed - Defines a dashed border

3. solid - Defines a solid border

4. double - Defines a double border

5. groove - Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border-color value

6. ridge - Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border-color value

7. inset - Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value

8. outset - Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value

9. none - Defines no border

10. hidden - Defines a hidden border

## **CSS Margins :**
The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
## **CSS Padding :**
The CSS ``padding`` properties are used to generate space around an element’s content, inside of any defined borders.With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).


## **Center Align Text :**
**To just center the text inside an element, use text-align: center;**
**Example:**


`` .center {
  text-align: center;
  border: 3px solid green;
}``


## **CSS border-image Property :**
Definition and Usage: The ``border-image`` property allows you to specify an image to be used as the border around an element.

The border-image property is a shorthand property for:

1. border-image-source
2. border-image-slice
3. border-image-width
4. border-image-outset
5. border-image-repeat
