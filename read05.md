## CSS Color :
Color can really bring your pages to life :

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

1. rgb values : These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
 2. hex codes : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
 3. color names :There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan.

## CSS Units :

CSS has several different units for expressing a length.Many CSS properties take “length” values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted.For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.
