# Learn how to compare in Javascript.
### First we going to check the tools that let me to compare between thing which is called comparsion operaitors
1- The == tool: this tools gives me true if I compare between things with the same datatype like numbers if they were equal gives me true or the strings if they are the same it will give me true.

2- The != tool: this one gives me true when things are wrong it is call unequal so when I write 1 != 2 it will give me true.

3- The === tool:this tool will give me true when the data type and the value are both equal like ‘3’ === ‘3’ is true because they have the same value and datatype.

4- The !== tool=this tool gives me true when the datatype and the value are not the same it like unequal but it checks the datatype and the value.

5- he <= tool:this allows me to compare between two values if the the value on the left is equal or smaller than the value on the right.

6- The >= tool:this allows me compare between two numbers to check if the number on the left is bigger or equal the number on the right.

## We could use logical operaitors to compare between coparsion operatiors
### We have some logical operaitors to be used and they are (AND,OR,NOT)

1- AND: will be represinted by this symbol && and if we compare between two results and one of them is false the AND resulte will be false.
2- OR: if we copmare between tow results and onr of them is true the OR resulte will be true.

3- NOT: will be represinted by this symbol ! and when we use it the boolean value will change so when we use it when the sentens is true it changes it to false.

#### other way to write the above logical is like False and anything or true or anything make it stops if it found a falsu in the first one and the second one it stops if there is any true.

### We use the logical operaitors in loops to make sure the the user has done the exact thing I want him to do Like for and while.
