As we can see the HTML is decoument has it is own tags and characteristics like:

* Every HTML decoument should stat with < !DOCTYPE html > tag and after it we should use < html > tag.

* The visible part of the decoument is between the < body > tag>

## **Extra markup**

1. HTML <!DOCTYPE> Declaration : All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an “information” to the browser about what document type to expect.


 2. HTML Comments : HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.


3. HTML id Attribute : The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). The id attribute is most used to point to a style in a style sheet, and by JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to manipulate the element with the specific id.


4. HTML class Attribute : The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.


5. HTML Block and Inline Elements : A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.


6. Escape Characters : Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

## **HTML5 Layout :**
#### HTML offers several elements that define the different parts of a web page:

```
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a container for navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent self-contained article
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element 
```

Those are a small example of HTML elemnet and there is more of them that gives us special features.

 You should make a WireFrames which is a basic drawing to clarify the basic boundaries that I have to deal with and create that make it easier to write the code.
